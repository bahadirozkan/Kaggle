# Kaggle

I'm gonna be posting the Jupyter Notebooks of my submissions for the Kaggle competitions. Right now, all notebooks are for the 
[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/submissions). </br> 
Submissions were done as a part of the Data Mining course I'm taking. Therefore, the submissions are to demnonstrate how different methods perform against the dataset.
